title: Facebook C# SDK Overview
---

This is the documentation for the Facebook C# SDK Version 6.0. You will find various tutorials and examples on how to use the SDK with ASP.NET, Windows Phone, Windows 8 Metro Style Apps, and Windows Azure.

Before you begin developing your Facebook app with the Facebook C# SDK we recommend you read the official [Facebook developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/). You cannot develop Facebook apps using the Facebook C# SDK without understanding the Facebook Graph API, Facebook Javascript SDK, or OAuth 2.0. These concepts are not addressed in the documentation for the Facebook C# SDK.
