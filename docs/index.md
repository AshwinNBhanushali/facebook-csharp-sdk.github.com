title: Facebook SDK for .NET Overview

This is the documentation for the Facebook SDK for .NET Version 6.0. You will find various tutorials and examples on how to use the SDK with ASP.NET, Windows Phone, Windows Store Apps, and Windows Azure.

Before you begin developing your Facebook app with the Facebook SDK for .NET we recommend you read the official [Facebook developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/). You cannot develop Facebook apps using the Facebook SDK for .NET without understanding the Facebook Graph API, Facebook Javascript SDK, or OAuth 2.0. These concepts are not addressed in the documentation for the Facebook SDK for .NET.
