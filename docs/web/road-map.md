title: Facebook SDK for .NET for Web Apps Road Map

Several days ago we migrated the Facebook SDK for .NET over to Github and released Facebook SDK for .NET Version 6.0 alpha. You can read more about that release in my blog post and Prabir's blog post. Since that release we have had several questions about the Facebook.Web and Facebook.Web.Mvc projects as well as the ASP.NET WebForms and ASP.NET MVC samples.
