title: Using the Facebook SDK for .NET with ASP.NET
---

Before you begin developing your Facebook app with the Facebook SDK for .NET we recommend you read the official [Facebook developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/). You cannot develop Facebook apps using the Facebook SDK for .NET without understanding the Facebook Graph API, Facebook Javascript SDK, or OAuth 2.0. These concepts are not addressed in the documentation for the Facebook SDK for .NET. 

Only after you have read the documents on Facebook's developer site should you proceed with the [getting started tutorial](/docs/web/getting-started) and other documentation on this site.
