title: Facebook C# SDK for ASP.NET
---

Before you begin developing your Facebook app with the Facebook C# SDK we recommend you read the official [Facebook developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/). You cannot develop Facebook apps using the Facebook C# SDK without understanding the Facebook Graph API, Facebook Javascript SDK, or OAuth 2.0. These concepts are not addressed in the documentation for the Facebook C# SDK. 

Only after you have read the documents on Facebook's developer site should you proceed with the [getting started tutorial](/docs/web/getting-started.html) and other documentation on this site.
