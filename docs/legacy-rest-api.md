# Using the Facebook C# SDK with the Legacy REST API
It is highly recommended to read the official Facebook documentation on Legacy REST Api which can be found at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/ before proceeding further. 

**Although legacy REST api is supported by Facebook C# SDK, it is highly discouraged to be used as Facebook is in the process of deprecating the legacy REST api.**
